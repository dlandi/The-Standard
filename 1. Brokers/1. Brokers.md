# 1 Brokers

## 1.0 Introduction
Brokers are a liaison between business logic and the outside world.
They are wrappers around external libraries, resources, services, or APIs to satisfy a local interface for the business to interact with them without having to be tightly coupled with any particular resources or external library implementation.

Brokers, in general, are meant to be disposable and replaceable - they are built with the understanding that technology evolves and changes all the time. Therefore,  at some point in the lifecycle of a given application, it will be replaced with a recent technology that gets the job done faster.

But Brokers also ensure that your business is pluggable by abstracting away any specific external resource dependencies from what your software is trying to accomplish.

For instance, let's say you have an API built to consume and serve data from a SQL server. At some point, you decided that a better, more economical option for your API is to rely on a NoSql technology instead. Having a broker to remove the dependency on SQL will make it much easier to integrate with NoSql with the least time and cost humanly possible.

## 1.1 On The Map
In any given application, mobile, desktop, web, or simply an API, brokers usually reside at the "tail" of any app because they are the last point of contact between our custom code and the outside world.

Whether the outside world in this instance is simply local storage in memory or an independent system that resides behind an API, they all have to reside behind Brokers in any application.

In the following low-level architecture for a given API - Brokers reside between our business logic and the external resource:

## 1.2 Characteristics
There are a few simple rules that govern the implementation of any broker - these rules are:

### 1.2.0 Implements a Local Interface
Brokers have to satisfy a local contract. They must implement a local interface to allow the decoupling between their implementation and the services that consume them.

For instance, given that we have a local contract `IStorageBroker` that requires an implementation for any given CRUD operation for a local model `Student` - the contract operation would be as follows:

```csharp
    public partial interface IStorageBroker
    {
        IQueryable<Student> SelectAllStudents();
    }
```

An implementation for a storage broker would be as follows:

```csharp
    public partial class StorageBroker
    {
        public DbSet<Student> Students { get; set; }

        public IQueryable<Student> SelectAllStudents() =>
            SelectAll<Student>();
    }
```
A local contract implementation can be replaced at any point in time, from utilizing the Entity Framework as shown in the previous example to using a completely different technology like Dapper or an entirely different infrastructure like an Oracle or PostgreSQL database.

### 1.2.1 No Flow Control
Brokers should not have any form of flow-control such as if-statements, while-loops, or switch cases - that's because flow-control code is considered to be business logic, and it fits better the services layer where business logic should reside, not the brokers.

For instance, a broker method that retrieves a list of students from a database would look something like this:

```csharp
        public IQueryable<Student> SelectAllStudents() => SelectAll<Student>();
```
A simple function that calls the native EntityFramework `DbSet<T>` and return a local model like `Student`. 


### 1.2.2 No Exception Handling
Exception handling is a form of flow control. Brokers are not supposed to handle any exceptions but rather let the exception propagate to the broker-neighboring services, where these exceptions can be properly mapped and localized.


### 1.2.3 Own Their Configurations
Brokers are also required to handle their configurations - they may have a dependency injection from a configuration object to retrieve and set up the configurations for whichever external resource they are integrating.

For instance, connection strings in database communications are required to be retrieved and passed into the database client to establish a successful connection, as follows:

```csharp
    public partial class StorageBroker : EFxceptionsContext, IStorageBroker
    {
        private readonly IConfiguration configuration;

        public StorageBroker(IConfiguration configuration)
        {
            this.configuration = configuration;
            this.Database.Migrate();
        }

        ...
        ...

        protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
        {
            optionsBuilder.UseQueryTrackingBehavior(QueryTrackingBehavior.NoTracking);
            string connectionString = this.configuration.GetConnectionString("DefaultConnection");
            optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer(connectionString);
        }
    }
```

### 1.2.4 Natives from Primitives
Brokers may construct an external model object based on primitive types passed by broker-neighboring services.

For instance, in an e-mail notification broker, input parameters for a `.Send(...)` function require the basic input parameters such as the subject, content, or address. Here's an example:

```csharp
    public async ValueTask SendMailAsync(List<string> recipients, string subject, string content)
    {
        Message message = BuildMessage(recipients, ccRecipients, subject, content);
        await SendEmailMessageAsync(message);
    }
```

The primitive input parameters will ensure there are no strong dependencies between the broker-neighboring services and the external models.
Even in situations where the broker is simply a point of integration between your application and an external RESTful API, it's very highly recommended that you build your native models to reflect the same JSON object sent or returned from the API instead of relying on NuGet libraries, DLLs or shared projects to achieve the same goal.

### 1.2.5 Naming Conventions
The contracts for the brokers shall remain as generic as possible to indicate the overall functionality of a broker; for instance, we say `IStorageBroker` instead of `ISqlStorageBroker` to indicate a particular technology or infrastructure.

With a single storage broker, it might be more convenient to maintain the same name as the contract. But in the case of concrete implementations of brokers, it all depends on how many brokers you have providing similar functionality. In our case, we have a concrete implementation of `IStorageBroker`, so the name would be `StorageBroker`.

However, if your application supports multiple queues, storage, or e-mail service providers, you might need to start specifying the overall target of the component; for instance, an `IQueueBroker` would have multiple implementations such as `NotificationQueueBroker` and `OrdersQueueBroker`.

But if the concrete implementations target the same model and business logic, then a diversion to the technology might be more befitting. In this case, for instance, `IStorageBroker`, two different concrete implementations could be `SqlStorageBroker` and `MongoStorageBroker`. This case is typical in situations where the intention is to reduce production infrastructure costs.

### 1.2.6 Language
Brokers speak the language of the technologies they support.
For instance, in a storage broker, we say `SelectById` to match the SQL `Select` statement, and in a queue broker, we say `Enqueue` to match the language.

If a broker is supporting an API endpoint, then it shall follow the RESTFul semantics, such as `POST`, `GET` or `PUT`. Here's an example:

```csharp

    public async ValueTask<Student> PostStudentAsync(Student student) =>
        await this.PostAsync(RelativeUrl, student);

```

### 1.2.7 Up & Sideways
Brokers cannot call other brokers; because brokers are the first point of abstraction, they require no additional abstractions or dependencies other than a configuration access model.

Brokers can't also have services as dependencies as the flow in any given system shall come from the services to the brokers and not the other way around.

For instance, even when a microservice has to subscribe to a queue, brokers will pass forward a listener method to process incoming events but not call the services that provide the processing logic.

The general rule here then would be that services can only call brokers; while brokers can only call external native dependencies.

## 1.3 Organization
Brokers supporting multiple entities, such as Storage brokers, should leverage partial classes to break down the responsibilities per entity.

For instance, if we have a storage broker that provides all CRUD operations for both `Student` and `Teacher` models, then the organization of the files should be as follows:

- IStorageBroker.cs
  - IStorageBroker.Students.cs
  - IStorageBroker.Teachers.cs
- StorageBroker.cs
  - StorageBroker.Students.cs
  - StorageBroker.Teachers.cs

The primary purpose of this particular organization, leveraging partial classes, is to separate the concern for each entity to a finer level, which should make the maintainability of the software much higher.

But broker file and folder naming conventions strictly focus on the plurality of the entities they support and the singularity for the overall resource supported.

For instance, we say `IStorageBroker.Students.cs`. And we also say `IEmailBroker` or `IQueueBroker.Notifications.cs` - singular for the resource and plural entities.

The same concept applies to the folders or namespaces containing these brokers.

For instance, we say:

```csharp
namespace OtripleS.Web.Api.Brokers.Storages
{
    ...
}
```

And we say:
```csharp
namespace OtripleS.Web.Api.Brokers.Queues
{
    ...
}
```

## 1.4 Broker Types
In most of the applications built today, some common Brokers are usually needed to get an enterprise application up and running - some of these are Storage, Time, APIs, Logging, and Queues.

Some brokers interact with existing resources on the system, such as *time* to allow broker-neighboring services to treat *time* as a dependency and control how a particular service would behave based on the value of time at any point in the past, present or the future.

### 1.4.0 Entity Brokers
Entity brokers provide integration points with external resources that the system needs to fulfill business requirements.

For instance, entity brokers integrate with storage, providing capabilities to store or retrieve records from a database.

Entity brokers are also like queue brokers, providing a point of integration to push messages to a queue for other services to consume and process to fulfill their business logic.

Broker-neighboring services can only call entity brokers because they require a level of validation on the data they receive or provide before proceeding any further.

### 1.4.1 Support Brokers
Support brokers are general purpose brokers, they provide the functionality to support services, but they have no characteristic that makes them different from any other system.

A good example of support brokers is the `DateTimeBroker` - a broker specifically made to abstract away the business layer's strong dependency on the system date time.

Time brokers don't target any specific entity, and they are almost the same across many systems.

Another example of support brokers is the `LoggingBroker` - they provide data to logging and monitoring systems to enable the system's engineers to visualize the overall flow of data across the system and be notified in case any issues occur.

Support Brokers may be called across the entire business layer: on foundation, processing, orchestration, coordination, management, or aggregation services, unlike Entity Brokers. That's because logging brokers are required as a supporting component in the system to provide all the capabilities needed for services to log their errors or calculate a date or any other supporting functionality.

You can find real-world examples of brokers in the OtripleS project [here](https://github.com/hassanhabib/OtripleS/tree/master/OtripleS.Web.Api/Brokers).

## 1.6 Summary
Brokers are the first layer of abstraction between your business logic and the outside world. But they are not the only layer of abstraction; because there will still be a few native models that leak through your brokers to your broker-neighboring services. It is natural to avoid doing any mappings outside the realm of logic; in our case, here, the foundation services.

For instance, in a storage broker, regardless of ORM used, some native exceptions from your ORM (EntityFramework, for example) will occur, such as `DbUpdateException` or `SqlException`. In that case, we need another layer of abstraction to play the role of a mapper between these exceptions and our core logic to convert them into local exception models. 

This responsibility lies in the hands of the broker-neighboring services. I also call them foundation services, these services are the last point of abstraction before your core logic that consists of local models and contracts.


## 1.7 FAQs
Over time, some common questions arose from the engineers I worked with throughout my career. Since some of these questions reoccurred on several occasions, I thought it might be helpful to aggregate them here for everyone to learn about other perspectives around brokers.

#### 1.7.0 Is the Brokers Pattern the same as the Repository Pattern?
Not exactly, at least from an operational standpoint, brokers seem to be more generic than repositories.

Repositories usually target storage-like operations, mainly towards databases. But brokers can be an integration point with any external dependency such as e-mail services, queues, and other APIs.

A more similar pattern for brokers is the Unit of Work pattern. It mainly focuses on the overall operation without having to tie the definition or the name with any particular operation.

All these patterns, in general, try to implement the same SOLID principles: separation of concern, dependency injection, and single responsibility.

But because SOLID are principles and not exact guidelines, it's expected to see all different implementations and patterns to achieve that principle.

#### 1.7.1 Why can't the brokers implement a contract for methods that return an interface instead of a concrete model?
That would be an ideal situation, but that would also require brokers to do a conversion or mapping between the native models returned from the external resource SDKs or APIs and the internal model that adheres to the local contract.

Doing that on the broker level will require pushing business logic into that realm, which is entirely outside that component's purpose.

We define business logic code as any intended sequential, selective, or iteration code. Brokers do not get unit tested because they have no business logic. They may be a part of an acceptance or an integration test but certainly not a part of unit-level tests - simply because they don't contain any business logic in them.

#### 1.7.2 If brokers were a layer of abstraction from the business logic, why do we allow external exceptions to leak through them onto the services layer?
Brokers are only the *first* layer of abstraction, but not the only one. The broker-neighboring services are responsible for converting the native exceptions occurring in a broker into a more local exception model that can be handled and processed internally within the business logic realm.

Business logic emerges in the processing, orchestration, coordination, and aggregation layers where all the exceptions, all the returned models, and all operations are local to the system.

#### 1.7.3 Why do we use partial classes for brokers who handle multiple entities?
Since brokers must own their configurations, it makes more sense to partialize when possible to avoid reconfiguring every storage broker for each entity.

Partial classes are a feature in the C# language, but it should be possible to implement the same behavior through inheritance in other programming languages.

#### 1.7.4 Are brokers the same as providers (Provider Pattern)?
No. Providers blur the line between services (business logic) and brokers (integration layer) - brokers are targeting particular components within the system that are disposable. Providers seem to include more than just that.
