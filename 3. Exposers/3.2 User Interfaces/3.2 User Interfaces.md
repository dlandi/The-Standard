# 3.2 User Interfaces

## 3.2.0 Introduction
User Interfaces or UI are a type of exposer component mainly targeting humans for interaction with the core business layer, unlike Communication protocols primarily used in distributed systems. UIs are forever evolving regarding technologies and methodologies with which humans can interact with any given system. This goes from web applications to virtual/augmented realities—voice-activated systems and, more recently, brain-waves-activated systems.

Developing user interfaces can be much more challenging in terms of experiences. There isn't a global standard today for what an intuitive understanding is. It heavily relies on culture, commonalities, and many other forever-changing variables today. This Standard will outline the principles and rules for building modular, maintainable, and pluggable UI components. But there will be a different Standard for outlining user experiences, human interactions, and the theory of intuitiveness.

This Standard also briefly highlights specific guidelines regarding rendering choices, server, client, or hybrid, as is the case with the tri-nature of everything. Let's dive deeper into the principles and rules that govern building UI components.

### 3.2.0.0 Principles & Rules
Just like every other exposer component type, UIs must be able to map processes, results, and errors to their consumers. Some of these UI components will require a test-driven approach. Some others are more like Brokers, just wrappers around 3rd party or native UI components. Let's talk about these principles here.

#### 3.2.0.0.0 Progress (Loading)
The most important principle in building UI components is to develop intelligence to keep the user engaged while a particular process is running, such as a simple spinner or a progress bar to keep users informed at all times of what's happening behind the scenes.

It's a violation of The Standard to indicate progress of any type if nothing really is going on in the background. It falls into the practice of wasting end-users time and lying to them about the actual status of the system. But assuming the system is busy working on a particular request, three levels of communication can happen on an exposer component to communicate progress. Let's discuss those in detail:

#### 3.2.0.0.0.0 Basic Progress
The basic progress approach is where you present a status with a label like "Waiting ..." or a spinner with no further indication, which is the bare minimum of progress indication. No UI should just freeze or stop their hanging while requests are being processed in the background, assuming an eventual-consistency pattern is not attainable for the current business need.

Some web applications show a forever progress bar at the very top of the page to indicate that progress is happening. From an experience perspective and depending on the visibility level of these progress bars, it may or may not be easy to miss by end users. Some other engineering teams have chosen to play a simple animation to keep users engaged with visual progress without any indication of the details of that progress.

#### 3.2.0.0.0.1 Remaining Progress
A bit above the bare minimum, there is an indication of remaining time or progress to be completed before the request is processed. An indication such as "40% remaining" or something more specific like "5 minutes remaining ..." to help end-users understand or guestimate how long a time or effort is left; or, there are patterns where engineers would indicate how many tasks remain without showing what these tasks are.

Sometimes a remaining progress update is as detailed as UI engineers can get. For instance, if you are downloading a file from the internet. You can't be more precise than "saying x percent of the bits remaining to be downloaded" with no further details. Some game developers also choose to visualize the internet speeds and available disk space to keep the end-user engaged in the system. And these are all acceptable patterns in this Standard.

#### 3.2.0.0.0.2 Detailed Progress
The highest level of reporting progress is the detailed progress type, where the UI component is fully transparent with its consumers by reporting every step of progress. This type of progress is more common in scientific applications. Engineers in debugging mode may enable a feature where all the underlying activity in the system is visualized through the UI.

This type helps end-users understand what is happening behind the scenes and allows them to communicate better details to support engineers to help them fix an issue if the process fails. But this process isn't always preferred in terms of experience, considering that some details need to be hidden for security reasons.

In summary, selecting the correct type of progress indicator in a UI depends on the business flow, the type of users interacting with the system, and several other variables we will discuss in The Experience Standard.

#### 3.2.0.0.1 Results
UI exposer components will report a result to indicate the completion of a particular request by end-users. Consider registering a new student in a schooling system. There are several ways to show the registration process has been completed successfully. Let's discuss those types of results visualization in detail here.

##### 3.2.0.0.1.0 Simple
The simple indication of success is when the UI reports that the process was completed without further details. You may have seen some of these implementations for this type, such as "Thank you, request submitted" or something as simple as a checkmark with a visualization of green color that indicates success.

Simple results indications, especially with submitted requests rather than retrieved data, may add more details in the next course of action.

##### 3.2.0.0.1.1 Partial Details
An overview of the nature of the request and where it stands in terms of status and timestamps: The other type of results or success indication is to present end-users with partial details. Partial details are usually helpful when it comes to providing the end-user with a "ticket number" to help end-users follow up on their requests later to inquire about the status. This pattern is typical in e-commerce applications where every purchase request may be returned with a tracking number to help customers and customer support personnel assess the requests.

Detailed results can also be very helpful for the visualization of the success process, especially with requests containing multiple parts. Larger requests, such as an application to join a university or the like, may include attachments, multiple pages of details, and confidential information such as payment details or social security numbers.

##### 3.2.0.0.1.2 Full Details
In some cases, one may prefer to report full details about the submitted request, especially with smaller requests where it may help end-users review their requests. Some engineers may display full details as an extra confirmation step before submitting the request. But full details can also include more than just the request details. It could include a status update from the server a long with an assigned point of contact or an officer from maintenance and support teams.

It's a violation of The Standard to redirect end-users at the submittal of their requests with no indication of what happened.

#### 3.2.0.0.2 Error Reports
Error reports primary responsibility is to inform end-users of what happened, why it happened, and the next course of action. Some error reports don't indicate any course of action, which can be a poor experience depending on the business flow. But the bare minimum in error reporting is the basic indication of the error with essential details. Let's talk about those types here.

##### 3.2.0.0.2.0 Informational
The bare minimum of error reports is the informational type. Indicating an error occurred and why it happened. Something like: "Request failed. Try again" or "Request failed, contract support". There are also informational errors that are time-based. Something like: "Our servers are currently experiencing a high volume of requests. Please try again later". These informational error reports are necessary to keep the end-user engaged with the system.

Informational error reports are governed by the context and the type of users receiving them. In a scientific application the more details the better. For some other systems, it is important to shift the technical language of the errors to a more less technical language. For instance, we can't communicate: "Student Id cannot be null, empty or widespace". We should select a more readable language such as: "Please provide a valid student Id".

##### 3.2.0.0.2.1 Referencial/Implicit Actions
The second type of error report is the referential type. When an error occurs, it automatically informs the support team and returns a reference of a support ticket to end users so they can follow up. You may see this a lot when video games fail to start, or certain applications are unable to initialize. Referential error reports are the best for certain business flows since they take care of all the actions, send an email to the end user with the reference number, and follow up within a couple of days to report the status.

The fewer actions a system requires users to take after a failure has occurred, the better. Since end-users have already accomplished their tasks in submitting requests, it becomes even more convenient if the original request is queued up, such as with high-volume enterprise systems, so end-users don't have to re-submit the same data.

##### 3.2.0.0.2.2 Actionable
The second type of error report is the actionable report. Errors provide an additional action for the users to go further in their request. For instance, error reports can provide a button to try again or submit other details request back to the engineering and support teams. 

Some reports will provide a different route to accomplish the same task in more hybrid legacy and modernized applications. These actionable reports are more convenient than informational reports. However, they would still require their end-users to take more actions and keystrokes, leading to a certain level of inconvenience.

#### 3.2.0.0.3 Single Dependency
Any exposer component can only integrate with a single dependency at a time. For UI components, contract purity ensures that a UI is not given more data than it needs. This is where a new type of foundational-like service is implemented to enforce this pattern, and all other details, such as audit fields, timestamps, and such, are taken care of away from the UI component sight.

We will talk in detail about view services shortly as we progress talking about UI exposers.

#### 3.2.0.0.4 Anatomy
Just like the data flow in any service. We have brokers -> Services -> Exposers. UI components also form their own data flow in terms of rendering. Let's take a look at the anatomy of UI exposers in this illustration:

    </div>
<br />

UI exposer components, as shown above, can be Bases, Components, or Containers. Each of these types has a specific responsibility to ensure the maximum maintainability and pluggability of the system according to The Standard. Let's discuss these three types here:

##### 3.2.0.0.4.0 Bases
Base or Base Components are just like Brokers in the data flow. They are simple thin wrappers around native or 3rd party components. Their primary responsibility is to abstract away the hard dependency on non-local components to allow the system's configuration to switch to any other external or native UI components with the least effort possible.

Base components also make it easier to mock out any external or native components behavior and focus the effort on ensuring the local component performs the expected way. We will discuss in the following chapter base components for web applications in Blazor and other technologies.

##### 3.2.0.0.4.1 Components
UI Components are a hybrid between a Service and a Controller in the data pipeline. In a way, components contain *some* business logic in the handling of interactions with certain base components. But they are also limited by integrating with one and only one view service. Components are test-driven. They require writing tests to ensure they behave as expected. But they also contain almost no iteration, selection, or sequencing data logic within them.

The most important aspect of UI components is the intersection between the UI flow and the data flow. They are responsible for leveraging their data dependency (view services) and their base components to become easily pluggable into container components (like pages with routes in web applications).

##### 3.2.0.0.4.2 Containers
Container components are orchestrators/aggregators of components. They are the actual route or the page end-users interact with. Containers cannot have any level of UI logic in them. They cannot leverage base components. And they may have any number of UI components as the business flow requires.

As it is the case with every category of components, containers cannot integrate with other containers. The rule applies across the board for every data or UI component.

#### 3.2.0.0.5 UI Component Types
UI components come in all different shapes and sizes. The hosting environment and the type of devices that serve these components play a significant role in determining the technologies and the capabilities a particular UI component may have. Let's talk about the different types of UI components in this section.

##### 3.2.0.0.5.0 Web Applications
The most popular type of UI application is the web application because of its ease of use. They require no installation of any kind. They have no dependency on the operating system running the system, or the type of devices users may be using. They can run on PCs, tablets, mobile phones, TVs, and watches that support web browsing.

Web frameworks have evolved greatly in the last few years due to their popularity, as mentioned earlier. Some frameworks allow engineers to write web applications in many programming languages. The web assembly evolution has also opened the door for engineers to develop even more scalable frameworks with their preferred technologies and languages.

Server-side applications and client-side applications. Web applications are developed in two different types in terms of rendering. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each type in addition to the hybrid model in the next few chapters of The Standard.

##### 3.2.0.0.5.1 Mobile Applications
The second most popular platform today to develop UIs is the mobile world. Developing mobile applications comes with challenges as they depend heavily on the operating system, the phone's size in terms of resolution, and the available native controls. Mobile applications are also always client-side apps. They are just like Desktop applications. They must be compiled, provisioned, and published to an app store so consumers can download, install, and leverage them in their daily activities.

The most significant advantage of mobile applications is that they allow offline interactions like mobile games, editing apps, and streaming services with offline capabilities. But building mobile applications with web frameworks is becoming increasingly popular as the web is a  universal ecosystem that allows end-users to experience software the same way on their PCs, browsers, and mobile applications. This trend shall eventually enable engineers to develop systems for all ecosystems at the least cost possible.

##### 3.2.0.0.5.2 Other Types
There are other types of UI components that we may not cover in our Standard. These types are console/terminal applications, desktop applications, video games, virtual/augmented reality software, wearable devices, and voice-activated systems. The world of Human-Machine-Interface HMI is evolving so rapidly in the age of the metaverse that we might need to create special chapters for these different types at some point.
